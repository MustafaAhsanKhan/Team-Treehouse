# A tuple is similar to a list in every way
# The only difference is that tuples are Immutable
# Meaning their contents cant be changed
# Their size remains constant after initialization

ints = 1,2,3,4,5  # This is a tuple  # The square brackets are removed
ints = (1,2,3,4,5)  # You can also replace the square brackets with parentheses

print(ints)

int = 1,  # This is a tuple with one element
